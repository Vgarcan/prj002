## CSS Management for Project Structure

The CSS for the project structure is organized to maintain consistency and responsiveness across all pages. Key strategies include:

1. **Global Styles:**
   - Shared styles, such as fonts, colors, and spacing, are defined in a global stylesheet. This ensures a cohesive look and feel across all pages.

2. **Responsive Design:**
   - Media queries are employed to adjust styles based on the device's screen size. This guarantees an optimal viewing experience on various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

3. **Class-Based Styling:**
   - Classes are used to apply consistent styling to elements shared across different pages, like navigation bars and footers. This simplifies maintenance and ensures uniformity.

4. **Specific Page Styles:**
   - Each main page has its own stylesheet, focusing on specific styles relevant to that page. This allows for targeted customization while maintaining a cohesive overall design.

By adopting these strategies, the CSS management ensures a visually pleasing and user-friendly interface while accommodating the unique characteristics of each page.

## Colors

The color scheme has been thoughtfully curated to evoke a dreamlike experience for users. Specific color choices aim to create a nocturnal ambiance, enhancing the overall theme of dreams. 

- **Blues for Nighttime Ambiance:**
  - Tonalities of blue are employed in the navigation bar and footer, contributing to a nighttime environment. This choice aims to immerse users in a dreamy atmosphere as they navigate through the platform.

- **Strategic Use of Pink:**
  - Pink is strategically used to draw attention to key elements. For instance, the "Register for Free" call-to-action features pink text, emphasizing its importance. The pink color is also applied to elements related to the dream diary, capturing the user's focus and adding a playful touch to the interface.

<img src="assets/img/readme-pics/pink-usage.jpg"></details>

- **Contrast with Black Text:**
  - Black text is predominantly used for readability. However, when emphasis is required, such as in the "Free" button or diary sections, pink is introduced to create visual contrast.

- **Dreamlike White and Pastels:**
  - The first section is predominantly white, evoking a dreamy and ethereal quality. The use of whites aims to convey an otherworldly, dream-like aesthetic. In contrast, the second section features soft pastel blues, creating a harmonious blend with pink, contributing to an innocent and playful overall design.

However, user testing has shown no problems with readability or visibility, and we have chosen to disregard this alert. Additionally, a similar issue is observed on the diary page, where the pink date may encounter responsiveness challenges. Despite this, visual inspection and user testing confirm that the content is visible and accessible.

Another point raised in the validation is the similarity of link URLs, where many are relative and deemed similar. Given the ongoing development and redirection to a 404 page, these URLs remain as such for the time being. It's acknowledged that this might affect the Wave Validation but is considered in the context of the evolving project.

# Bugs and Challenges

While developing the Dream Reader Project, I encountered several challenges and bugs, particularly when working with Bootstrap and validating CSS. Here's an overview of the issues faced and how they were addressed:

## Bootstrap Challenges

### Validation Issues:
During the development process, I noticed that Bootstrap's classes and components sometimes triggered validation errors when using a CSS validator. These issues included unrecognized properties, invalid values, or unknown pseudo-classes.

### Overcoming Validation Errors:
To address validation errors, I adopted the following strategies:

1. **Selective Validation:**
   - As Bootstrap is a widely-used framework, some of its classes may not be recognized by CSS validators. Rather than attempting to address every validation error, I opted for selective validation, focusing on critical aspects of the project.

2. **Ignore Known Issues:**
   - Some validation errors were related to Bootstrap's dynamic styles or browser-specific properties. Understanding these nuances, I chose to ignore certain known issues that didn't impact the project's functionality or appearance.

3. **Validation Explanations:**
   - In the project documentation, I included a section explaining that certain validation errors were expected due to the use of Bootstrap. This helps users understand the reasons behind the errors and assures them that the project adheres to best practices where possible.

## CSS Validation

### Bootstrap-Specific Classes:
Bootstrap's extensive set of classes introduces non-standard attributes that may not pass standard CSS validation. This is due to the dynamic nature of Bootstrap's styling.

### Workarounds:
To manage CSS validation challenges related to Bootstrap, I implemented the following workarounds:

1. **Manual Validation Review:**
   - After applying Bootstrap classes, I manually reviewed the validation results to differentiate between Bootstrap-related errors and genuine issues in the project's custom styles.

2. **Custom Styles Organization:**
   - I organized custom styles separate from Bootstrap styles where possible, allowing for a more focused review of potential validation errors.

3. **Documentation Clarity:**
   - In the project's documentation, I provided clarity on the use of Bootstrap and acknowledged that validation errors might occur due to its unique styling approach.

## Font Selection Challenge

Exploring alternative fonts led us to the realization that our current font choice not only complements our desired aesthetic but also performs exceptionally well across various browsers and devices. Despite attempts to experiment with different fonts, none surpassed the qualities of our current font.

### **Resolution:**

After thorough testing and assessment, I made a deliberate decision to maintain the existing font. Its visual appeal and consistent performance across platforms align with our project's identity, emphasizing a user-centric approach to ensure a positive experience.

## GitHub Deployment Issue:
During deployment on GitHub Pages, we encountered an issue where the image "banner4.png" on "diary.html" failed to load. This issue appears to be specific to GitHub deployment, as the image is accessible via its direct URL [here](https://vgarcan.github.io/prj002/assets/img/banners/banner4.png). This discrepancy suggests a potential error in the deployment process on GitHub. To ensure a seamless experience, we recommend accessing the project on [Azure](https://ambitious-bush-0d5afce1e.4.azurestaticapps.net/).
